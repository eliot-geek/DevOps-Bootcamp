# DevOps-Bootcamp
The DevOps Bootcamp is a comprehensive series of projects designed to build foundational skills in UNIX/Linux systems, networking, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. 

The **D01_Linux-1** project is an introductory exploration into UNIX/Linux operating systems, covering installation, basic administration, and essential utilities. This project includes setting up virtual machines, configuring network settings, using command-line tools, key administration tasks such as using the `sudo` command, configuring time services, setting up SSH for remote access, and utilizing various system monitoring and disk management tools like `top`, `htop`, `fdisk`, `df`, and `du`, automation of tasks through the CRON job scheduler, and managing system logs and services.

The **DO2_LinuxNetwork-1** project focuses on configuring Linux networks on virtual machines. It covers the TCP/IP protocol stack, IP addressing, and routing, both static and dynamic. Key tasks include using tools like `ipcalc` for network calculations, configuring static routing between machines, and optimizing network performance with `iperf3`. The project also addresses network security through firewall configuration, NAT setup, and dynamic IP management via DHCP. Additionally, it introduces SSH tunnels for secure network communications. This project provides a solid foundation in Linux network management and essential networking utilities.

The **DO5_SimpleDocker-1** project introduces the basics of Docker, focusing on developing a simple Docker image for a custom server. The project covers essential topics like setting up and configuring Nginx within Docker containers, performing container operations, and creating a mini web server. Additionally, it explores security best practices using Dockle, and provides an introduction to Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications. This project equips learners with the foundational skills needed to build, manage, and secure Dockerized environments.

The **DO6_CICD-1** project focuses on the development of a basic CI/CD pipeline for the SimpleBashUtils project. It covers the fundamentals of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD), guiding through setting up a GitLab Runner, automating the build process, running codestyle checks, performing integration tests, and managing the deployment stage. Additionally, the project includes setting up notifications to track the status of the pipeline. This project provides a practical introduction to CI/CD practices, essential for modern software development workflows.
